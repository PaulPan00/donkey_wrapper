`You cannot!`

Just joking haha. Submit a Pull Request and i will carefully review your changes and merge it into the main branch. EVERYONE is welcomed to contribute!!
- **Why do I need to learn Python? Is it too late to learn it in 2021?**


Python is incredibly easy to use and learn for beginners (like me), or intermediate programmers (like me), or geek coders (like me).

Python is heavily backed by Facebook, Amazon Web Services, and Google.

Python developer community is one of the most active communities.

Python has excellent libraries.

It is never, ever, late to learn Python!!
